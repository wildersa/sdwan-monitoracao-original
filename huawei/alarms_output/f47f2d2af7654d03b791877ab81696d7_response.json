Then, you need to check whether the address of the BGP neighbor can be pinged successfully. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 21. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 5. \n\n5.Run the display ip routing-table command to check whether the Destination/Mask field has the route to the peer address. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 7. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 8. \n\n6.Run the display acl all command to check whether the router is configured with the ACL that disables TCP port 179. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 9. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 10. \n\n7.Run the display ip interface brief command to check whether the values of Physical and Protocol fields of the outbound interface are Up. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 23. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 11. \n\n8.Check the origin of the route with the BGP peer address. \n\u2022If the route is originated from OSPF, go to Step 12. \n\u2022If the route is originated from IS-IS, go to Step 13. \n\u2022Else, go to Step 23. \n\n9.Delete the ACL that disables the TCP port 179, and check whether the trap BGP_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.177.1.3.9 hwBgpPeerEstablished appears later. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 24. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 10. \n\n10.Check the BGP configuration to see whether loopback interfaces are used to establish BGP peers. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 14. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 15. \n\n11.Enter the view of the outbound interface, and run the display this command to check whether the interface is shut down. \n\u2022If so, run the undo shutdown command to enable the interface. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 22. \n\n12.Run the display ospf peer command to check whether the OSPF peer relationship is established. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 23. \n\u2022If not, refer to the solution provided in the case of trap OSPF_1.3.6.1.2.1.14.16.2.2 ospfNbrStateChange. \n\n13.Run the display isis peer command to check whether the IS-IS peer relationship is established. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 23. \n\u2022If not, refer to the solution provided in the case of trap ISIS_1.3.6.1.3.37.2.0.13 isisRejectedAdjacency. \n\n14.Check whether the peer connect-interface is configured for specifying the source address. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 15. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 16. \n\n15.If BGP is the EBGP neighbor relationship and multiple hops exist between EBGP neighbors, check whether the peer ebgp-max-hop is configured. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 17. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 19. \n\n16.Configure the peer connect-interface command. The parameter in the command must be the local interface that establishes a connection with the peer. Then, check whether the trap BGP_1.3.6.1.4.1.2011.5.25.177.1.3.9 hwBgpPeerEstablished appears later. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 24. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 23. \n\n17.Check whether the peer valid-ttl-hops hops command is configured. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 18. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 23. \n\n18.If the peer valid-ttl-hops hops is configured, check whether the TTL of the packet to the peer ranges from [255-hops+1] to 255. \n\u2022If so, go to Step 23. \n\u2022If not, go to Step 20. \n\n19.Configure the peer ebgp-max-ho",
